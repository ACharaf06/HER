# Women Heart Disease Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease in women using various machine learning models. The goal is to analyze and model a dataset with features relevant to heart health, ultimately to predict the presence of heart disease.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains several features that are considered important in diagnosing heart disease, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to validate the performance of our models.

This dataset is availible in KAGGLE.

## Models Used
Several machine learning models are explored and evaluated in this project, including:

    Logistic Regression
    Naive Bayes
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Decision Tree
    Random Forest
    XGBoost

Each model's performance is assessed based on its accuracy in predicting heart disease presence in the test data
